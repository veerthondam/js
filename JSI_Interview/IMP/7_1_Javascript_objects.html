    <h1> Javascript Objects </h1>
    <div style="font-size: larger">
        Jasvascript is an Object based or prototype based Language.<br/>
        i.e, in Javascript objects are created with the help of prototypes.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        What is prototype ?
        <br/>
            prototype is an object, which contains common functionalities that 
            javascript object inherits.<br/>
            I.e, When Javascript object is created, it inherits the 
            common functionalities present inside a prototype object 
            from which it is built.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any Javascript Object is a collection of Properties and has a prototype.
    <br/>
    Property:
        It is a key value pair.<br/>
        where <br/>
        <b>key</b> is the name of the property,<br/>
        <b>value</b> is the value of the property  and it can be data, an object or a function.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b> Data Property: attribute </b>
            <br/>
            If a property's value is a data, or an object then it is called Data property<br/>
            It represents <b>attribute</b> of an object
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Function Property: Behavior </b>
            <br/>
            If a property's value is a function then it is called function property or method<br/>
            It represents <b>behavior</b> of an object
              
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Note:** </b>
            <br/>
            1) &nbsp;Javascript object is a collection of objects. <br/>
            2) &nbsp;Every Javascript object is a associated with a prototype from which
             it is built. <br/>
            3) &nbsp;All Javascript objects inherit their common functionalities 
            from their prototype. <br/>
            4) &nbsp;Javascript objects are dynamic, i,e.., <br/>
               we can add Properties to an object or delete properties from an object at 
               <b> run time.</b>
